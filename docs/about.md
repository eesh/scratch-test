# [Scratch][scratch-link]
With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share your creations with others in the online community.

Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively — essential skills for life in the 21st century.

Scratch is a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is provided free of charge.

# [Scratch Extensions][scratch-extensions-link]
Scratch extensions make it possible for Scratch to interface with external hardware and information outside of the Scratch website through new blocks. Extensions are written in JavaScript for the ScratchX project editor.
