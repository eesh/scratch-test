# Scratch doesn't connect to Poppy Ergo Jr.

* Check if the robot is connected to network. Are you able to access the robots control panel page if you go to the robots IP in the browser?

* Check if the IP format in the Call block is correct. The format should be http://ipaddress:6969/

# Tracking doesn't work

* Check if camera is enabled by going to configuration page in the web browser. http://ipadress/ should load the robots control panel. If it doesn't, you are not on the same network of the robot.

* The camera might be a little slow at detecting markers. Place the markers at least 10cm away and make sure the markers are directly pointing the camera.
